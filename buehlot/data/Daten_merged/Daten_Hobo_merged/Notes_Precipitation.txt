Notes regarding precipitation data:

- Schönbrunn logged only daily instead of 5 min interval from 27/11/20 till 02/03/21 
 	-> those values were completely diregarded (temperature logged fine)

- At Hundseck, the magnetic contact broke several times
 hence there are large periods with precipitation logged as 0 by mistake

-Sometimes one csv file from hobo has two different datetime formats, 
 that was manually delt with
 The files with this abnomality always also have only zeros in the precipitaion column
 Also temperature was then logged not on full minutes but e.g. 10:00:22 and so on 

- Often logger stored a tipping event as 1 and not 0.2 mm of precipitation,
 during import, if 1mm was the most frequent value, the precipitation data was 
 mulitiplied by 0.2 (and file was manually checked if that was justified)
