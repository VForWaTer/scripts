# VForWaTer scripts

The purpose of this collection is to collect Notebooks that were used to setup our V-FOR-WaTer installation. E.g. transforming and uploading specific data samples. Usually this stuff is to specific to push it to other repositories like metacatalog, bridget or hyrobox

### There are private data samples in the repo, so do not make it public


## Contributing

Each topic should go into it's own subfolder. Please also add a `README.md`, `requirements.txt` and stuff like that. No top-level definitions to keep the subfolders self-contained.
